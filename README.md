# Multi-PCSF
An implementation of the Multi-PCSF algorithm described in [Gitter et al 2014].
This version of the PCSF code is no longer under active development.  Please
see [Omics Integrator] for the current version of PCSF from Ernest Fraenkel's
lab.  The Omics Integrator website describes how to install the [msgsteiner]
dependency, which is also required by Multi-PCSF.
